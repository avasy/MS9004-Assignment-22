# MS9004-Assignment-22
BACKGROUND BRIEF
The data set is collected from an experiment using mice in a biological lab environment. The aim of the experiment is to assess the effect of medication in recovering the ability to learn in mice with chromosome abnormality.

In this assignment, we boil the question down to predicting the expression level of a certain protein, which produces detectable signals in the brain cortex of mice. Predictors include expression levels of a number of other proteins, and some qualitative attributes.
